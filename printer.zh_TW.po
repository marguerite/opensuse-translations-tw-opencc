#. for example when the queue has a special non-autodetectable DeviceURI (e.g. for iPrint)
#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).
#. Therefore -1 (which means "invalid index number in the connections list") is used to be safe
#. and additionally -1 is used to distinguish when the current connection is kept

"<b><big>Percent Encoding</big></b><br>\n"
"The issue is complicated.\n"
"It is recommended to avoid reserved characters and spaces\n"
"for component values in URIs if the values are under your control\n"
"(e.g. you cannot avoid it when you must specify such characters\n"
"in values for an URI to access a remote print queue\n"
"but the remote print queue is not under your control).\n"
"Whenever possible use only so called 'unreserved characters'.\n"
"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"
"decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.\n"
"Even hyphen, period, tilde, and case sensitivity\n"
"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"
"for a CUPS print queue name and case is not significant there).\n"
"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"
"When an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"only a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. separated input fields for username and password),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters literally\n"
"(i.e. non-percent-encoded).\n"
"For such input fields all spaces and reserved characters\n"
"will be automatically percent-encoded.\n"
"For example if a password is actually 'Foo%20Bar' (non-percent-encoded),\n"
"it must be entered literally in the password input field in the dialog.\n"
"The automated percent-encoding results 'Foo%2520Bar' which is how\n"
"the value of the password component is actually stored in the URI.<br>\n"
"In contrast when an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"more that a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. a single input field for all optional parameters\n"
"like 'option1=value1&amp;option2=value2&amp;option3=value3'\n"
"or a single input field to enter the whole URI),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters percent-encoded\n"
"because an automated percent-encoding is no longer possible.\n"
"Assume in an optional parameter 'option=value'\n"
"the value would be 'this&amp;that' so that the whole\n"
"optional parameter would be 'option=this&amp;that' (literally).\n"
"But a literal '&amp;' character denotes\n"
"the separation of different optional parameters\n"
"so that 'option=this&amp;that' in an URI means\n"
"a first optional parameter 'option=this' and\n"
"a second optional parameter which is only 'that'.\n"
"Therefore a single optional parameter 'option=this&amp;that'\n"

"<b><big>百分號編碼</big></b><br>\n"
"該問題很複雜。\n"
"建議您避免在 URI 中使用保留字元與空格作為元件值，如果您能控制的話 (例如當您必須在 URI 中指定這樣的字元作為值以訪問遠端列印佇列，但遠端列印佇列又不在您控制下時，您就無法避免使用它們)。\n"
"可能的情況下請僅使用 '非保留值'。\n"
"非保留值包括大小寫字母，十位數字，連字元，句號，下劃線與波浪號。\n"
"甚至在特殊情況下，連字元，句號，波浪號與大小寫都會導致特殊問題 (例如，僅有字元，數字與下劃線已知可以用作 CUPS 列印佇列名，它們一般沒有什麼顯著問題)。\n"
"因此若可能最好僅使用小寫字母，數字，與下劃線作為 URI 中的值。<br>\n"
"元件中的保留字元與空格字元必須以百分比編碼 (也叫做 URL 編碼)。<br>\n"
"當對話方塊中輸入框是用來輸入 URI 的一個元件的一個值時 (例如，使用者名與密碼的輸入框是分開的)，您必須按字面輸入空格與保留字元 (非百分比編碼)。這樣的輸入框會自動編碼所有空格與保留字元。\n"
"例如密碼實際上是 'Foo%20Bar' (非百分比編碼)，您必須在對話方塊中的密碼輸入框中按字面輸入 'Foo%20Bar'。URI 中的密碼元件值實際上儲存的是自動百分比編碼的結果 'Foo%2520Bar'。相反當對話方塊中輸入框是用來輸入 URI 的一個元件的多於一個值時 (例如，一個給所有可選參數如 'option1=value1&amp;option2=value2&amp;option3=value3' 的輸入框或者一個輸入框裡輸入整個 URI)，您必須輸入編碼過的空格與保留字元，因為這時沒有自動編碼。\n"
"假設一個可選參數 'option=value' 的輸入，value 就應該是 'this&amp;that' 因此整個可選參數應該是 'option=this&amp;that' (字面上)。\n"
"但是字面上的 '&amp;' 字元意味著不同可選參數的分隔符，因此 URI 中的 'option=this&amp;that' 意思是第一個可選參數是 'option=this'，第二個可選參數僅是 'that'。\n"
"因此一個單獨的可選參數 'option=this&amp;that' 必須以百分比編碼格式輸入為 'option=this%26%that'。<br>\n"
"要求百分比編碼輸入的輸入框由 '[percent-encoded]' 提示語表示。<br>\n"

#. Therefore it takes by default 5 minutes until printer information
#. that was previously received by Browsing is removed (via timeout)
#. from the local cupsd's list.
